Generally, I'm feeling pretty confident about my Python skills.
In all honesty, I was very nervous coming into this class as it's been
a bit of time since I've programmed in Python. Though, through the exercises
and the lab, I've felt a lot more confident, and they've been great refreshers
for me as a programmer. Through the various exercises, I've rekindled my 
familiarity with Python. The hands-on approach adopted in the class has undoubtedly 
contributed to my overall confidence in working with Python. I don't really have a 
particular thing I feel more confident in than I do with others. However, when it 
comes to classes, I have to admit that they have always been a challenge for me. 
Despite my progress in Python and programming in general, classes have always been
something that have perplexed me a bit, and something that needs more of my focus and improvement. 
It's an aspect where I recognize the need for more practice and understanding, especially
being how useful they are. In summary, the journey of getting myself back into Python 
has been very rewarding, thanks to the class activities and exercises. While my confidence 
has grown significantly in various Python concepts, I am mindful of the ongoing challenge 
posed by classes. Nonetheless, I am committed to addressing this and continuing to 
thrive as a Python programmer.
